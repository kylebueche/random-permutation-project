# A GCC + Makefile Template for Writing C Code

 - Clone this repository
 - Run make clean once
 - The Makefile manages dependencies in src/ automatically!

 The dependencies and object files are stored in the build directory, which make clean creates.

 If src/ has subdirectories, the Makefile must be modified to detect them and handle building.
